	 <div id="About"><h2>"What Would You Do If You Were Not Affraid?</h2>
	<p>I have always had a mechanical aptitude as well as a creative side. My goal is to bring both of these passions together to help as many people as I can through my coding. Gschool can help me accomplish this goal and make my passion a career. I plan on taking on as many roles as I can through my new found career. I believe that we are always evolving and the more open minded we become it allows us to grow that much more. </p></div>
