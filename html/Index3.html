		<div id="about"><h2> "Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying"</h2><p>Hi, My name is Sam. At 37 years old I have bought two homes, sold one and gutted and remodeled the other. I lived on the Big island of Hawaii and just recently completed my first half marathon. I am native to Denver and just celebrated my fifteen year aniversary as a Slot Technician in the Casino Industry. Some activities I enjoy are running with my dog Kalea, hiking and rockclimbing. I am the oldest of my brother and I and play the role of uncle for his two girls. I am currently single with no kids but would like to raise a family and add the roles of dad and husband to my resume. I also enjoy a good beer, I could go for a Left Hand Milk Stout right about now.</p></div>
