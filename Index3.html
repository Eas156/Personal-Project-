		<div class="about"<p> I grew up living with my mother and younger brother in Lakewood, CO. We would visit my father every other weekend in Southwest Denver but knew our home was in Lakewood. Times were differant back then. I remember only having access to a computer at school or at the library. As my brother and I started taking college courses the need for our own personal computer grew. This is when my mother made the decision to contact Dell to buy us a family computer. I'm not sure how you grew up, but this was a huge deal for us. This is where my interest in computers began. I had always been mechanical but having a computer to learn about hardware, memory and trouble shooting was a game changer for me. After 15 years as a slot machine technician I become interested in learning software and how the code affects the outcome of the game. Having developed a couple of static web pages I found myself looking for more. We all know how helpful the internet is, but there is also a thing as too much information. I had no idea what language to learn or what my next step was. I was interested in going back to school for a C.S. degree but wanted a better option. This is when I came across Galvanize on a web search. I Immediately started looking at reviews and starting my appplication process.</p></div>
